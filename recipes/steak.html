<h3> Description</h3>
<p> Cooking a steak properly can seem daunting, but all you 
    need is a little time management, a little seasoning
    and a willingness to eat
    a few steaks that aren't quite there. 
</p>
<p> 
    <h4> Timing</h4>
    To cook your steak to exactly the way you like it (no
    Hank Hill style judgements here), primarily comes from the cooking time.
    
    Below we have a breakdown of the best cooking times for each 
    level of cooking:
    <ul>
        <li>Rare: 1.5 mins per side.</li> 
        <li>Medium rare: 2 mins per side.</li> 
        <li>Medium: About 2.25 mins per side. </li>
        <li>Well-done steak: about 4-5 mins each side,.</li>
    </ul>
   Remember, start that pan out nice and hot and then bring the flame to a nice 
   medium heat, once the steak is in.

    <h4>Seasoning</h4>
    Seasoning your steak can be as complex or as simple as you
    would like. As a bare minimum, a healthy dose of salt and pepper
    should be added, but try out whatever herbs, spices or marinades you like.
    A simple way to spruce up your steak is simply a nob of butter and a few sprigs of rosemary, added 
    to the pan a minute or so before the steak. Then, baste away!
