<h3> Description</h3>
<p> Roasting a duck is nothing to be afraid of. As long as you
    have a few hours and some patience, we will have you pulling
    your first roasted duck out the oven like its nothing. 
</p>
<p> 
    <h4> Timing</h4>
    To Roast a duck, you must first know it's weight. For each
    kilogram of duck you have, it will need 40 minutes, plus 
    an additional 10 minutes in the oven.
    
    Below we have a breakdown of some example cooking times:
    <ul>
        <li>1kg: 50 mins.</li> 
        <li>1.3kg: 62 mins.</li> 
        <li>1.7kg: 78 mins. </li>
        <li>2.5 kg: 110 mins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Seasoning</h4>
    Seasoning your duck should be simple, just salt and pepper 
    will really bring out the flavours of the duck. However, we
    recommend getting a selection of your favourite vegetables
    to surround the bird as it roasts.
